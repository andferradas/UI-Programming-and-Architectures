- IDENTIFY BARRIERS
    1. Visual impairments
    Users with limited vision or color blindness may struggle to identify the selected shape or color. 
    For example, the color picker only shows a visual color box, with no text label or alternative description.
    2. Limited mobility
    Currently, the app can only be used with a mouse. 
    This makes it difficult or impossible for users who rely on the keyboard or assistive technologies to interact with it.

- APPLY A STRATEGY
    - Change the environment: make visual information (like the selected color and shape)
    more perceptible through text and better contrast.
    - Use a tool: add keyboard shortcuts so users can draw and control the app without using a mouse.

- TARGET A UNIVERSAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE
    1. Perceptible Information: The app now displays the current color and shape in text form,
    making the interface understandable for users who cannot rely only on visual cues.
    2. Low Physical Effort: Keyboard shortcuts allow users to perform the same actions (selecting shapes, undoing,clearing)
    without needing precise mouse control.

- REDESIGN AND DOCUMENT
    1. Show current color as text
    This helps users with vision impairments or color blindness identify the chosen color 
    through readable text instead of relying on color perception.
    2. Add keyboard shortcuts
    Users who cannot use a mouse can still interact with the app using only the keyboard, 
    reducing physical effort.
    3. Improve button visibility
    This ensures higher contrast for users with visual impairments
    and a visible focus outline for keyboard navigation.
